# <h1 align="center">Exo: One Stop Shop for Your Interstellar Needs</h1>

## Background (Etsy clone)

Thank the stars we're here! Ever since Elon Musk left our crust in the year 0002 (post melt), it's been a scramble to secure a place in the stars. But not any more! No more wondering where to go, no more dreading what you'll eat on the way, no more forgoing fashion for the functional-- ¡¿Por qué no los dos!? Exo is your basecamp for your journey into the beyond, but act fast; for as we know, resources are limited.

## Technologies & Technical Challenges
* Our goal is to implement a selection of APIs to create as immersive an evironment as possible. Thus far we plan to pull from the NASA Exoplanet API, Amazon product APIs, and some for fleshing out visual components (NASA picture of the day, etc.)
** We anticipate challenges in showing uniform product pages with multiple different data streams depending on product category
