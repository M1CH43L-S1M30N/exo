# Exo: One Stop Shop for Your Interstellar Needs
## Background

Thank the stars we're here! Ever since Elon Musk left our crust in the year 0002 (post melt), it's been a scramble to secure a place in the stars. But not any more! No more wondering where to go, no more dreading what you'll eat on the way, no more forgoing fashion for the functional-- ¡¿Por qué no los dos!? Exo is your basecamp for your journey into the beyond, but act fast; for as we know, resources are limited.
